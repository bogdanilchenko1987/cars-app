## About the project

The Car Dealer App project is an application using Next.js. The application allows users to filter
vehicles by type and model year, and view the results on a Results page. On the Home page, you will
see a form where you can choose a car model and a year of manufacturing. The Next button is enabled
only when a vehicle type and model year are selected. Then it navigates to the Results page, where
you can see all found cars.

This project was created using React, TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. Feel free to contact me
to ask any questions.
